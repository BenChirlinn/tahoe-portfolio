  "synopsis": "I most recently worked at [*Twitch.tv*](https://www.twitch.tv/) on the Creator Experience and then Creator Broadcast teams. Our goal was to support and empower the many diverse creators of Twitch, helping them build their audience while improving the quality of their content. I specifically enjoyed working on projects that I knew would directly benefit the communities and creators I so love on Twitch.\n\nI came into Twitch leveraging the React and GQL skills I perfected at my previous role and went on to learn how to contribute to Twitch's Go and AWS based microservices. When I later began working on Twitch Studio I began ramping up on C++ and Electron as well. Some major projects I contributed to were [Twitch Studio](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/08/08/twitch-studio-going-live-is-getting-a-whole-lot-easier-ee64251bcf5/), [Squad Streaming](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/03/27/squad-stream-the-next-way-to-play-and-watch-together-32d9ad2ac555/), and the [updated dashboard for creators](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/creator-dashboard).",
