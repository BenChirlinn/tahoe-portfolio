  "synopsis": "I currently work at [*GoodRx*](https://www.goodrx.com/) on brand drug products that help get otherwise expensive medications to consumers at an affordable price. I previously worked on the GoodRx subscriptions team, which delivered a premium **Gold** experience to our customers.\n\nWorking in the healthcare space has been a rewarding challenge, and I've learned a lot about how to pair cutting-edge tools with the needs of legacy systems. At GoodRx, I've worked on backend services that maintain sensitive customer information, complex GraphQL solutions, SQL and PostgreSQL databases, Stripe integration, and a gorgeous frontend powered by *Next.js* and React, using the latest in server-side technology to help improve the user experience.
