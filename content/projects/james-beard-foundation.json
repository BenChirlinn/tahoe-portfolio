  "synopsis": "While at *The Mechanism* I worked on a small team to help realize a modern website for this illustrious non-profit. Since replaced, we built this Drupal-based website with designs from the client.\n\nI was responsible for the frontend, site navigation, structure, and third party service integration (Twitter, Facebook, Open Table, Urbanspoon).\n\nMoreover I was given free reign to design and build certain interface widgets that weren't fleshed out in the original specifications like custom calendar and search widgets.",
