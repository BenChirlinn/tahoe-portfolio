  "synopsis": "After I joined the brand team at GoodRx, our main task was migrating our entire web application to a new platform powered by the latest *Next.js* framework. I helped coordinate the transition of all our various brand products into streamlined, performant components that significantly reduced tech debt while improving performance and readability. I drove reusability across the new application and improved documentation across the board. I still relish every time one of my early platform decisions pays dividends by making the latest product changes less of a zigzag for our engineering team.",
