# Tahoe Theme React Portfolio Site

This is a basic react application that I use as my personal portfolio as deployed to [BenjaminChirlin.com](http://www.benjaminchirlin.com).

## Technology and Libraries

I tried to use a broad production-scale group of technologies to support this project. It was important to me that it reflect all my knowledge of web development from backend to front. Moreover it allowed me the opportunity to get into the weeds on many of the setup and configuration steps I missed during my time at WIRED as I came into our React project after the groundwork had already been laid.

Included libraries and technologies:

- Digital Ocean (DO)
- Ubuntu
- Nginx
- Webpack
- Babel
- React

# Requirements
As this is an older project it requires Node 11.15.0 to properly run in its present state (as specified in the `engines` requirement in `package.json`). Using `nvm` is recommended to easily swap to this required version.

# Deployment

I opted to manage deploys directly through git (see resources below for reference). This involved setting up a separate bare git origin on my DO droplet (called *live*) which I can push my latest changes to. There, a `post-receive` hook ensures my Git work tree, a.k.a. the key site files themselves, are put in my server's root site directory. `npm run build` must then be run manually from there to build the latest.

### Deployment Walkthrough

- Push latest changes to the repo from local to "live" remote (`ssh://root@MY_SERVER_IP/srv/tahoe-portfolio/site.git`)
- SSH into server
- Navigate to work tree at `/srv/www/benjaminchirlin.com`
- Install latest dependencies if required `npm i`
- Build latest `npm run build`
- Rejoice at how relatively simple and easy to maintain this pipeline is! :tada:

### Debug

- `npm install` in root directory
- `npm run dev` to spin up local build/server
- Go to the [localhost](http://localhost:8080/) to see in action `http://localhost:8080/`
- Note there is no live reload on file save so you have to manually restart debug to see changes


# Webpack Config

## HTML

For now the HTML is loaded via `html-webpack-plugin` which adds all needed meta data and icons (via `favicons-webpack-plugin`). This may need to change once routing is added.

## LESS/CSS

LESS is loaded via `extract-text-plugin` which generates the CSS via LESS loader and auto-prefixes the output.

## Fonts

Fonts are all loaded via `url-loader` and as such are hash encoded. Because we have a custom font this feels most secure.

## Images

Images are loaded either view `url-loader` (attempting to in-line them) or `file-loader`. Ensure all images that need to be included in the build are included (I've dumped all these in `index.js` so far).

I attempted to find an automated way of doing this but because several components dynamically generate image names it looked like it would be more trouble than it was worth. However I did leave in the `transform-react-jsx-img-import` plug-in so any `<img>` tags in JSX files with an explicitly defined source should have their image auto-included.

### URL Loader Images

Webpack will attempt to in-line any images placed in the `images/url-loader` directory that are small enough (< 8kb). All such images will be built to the `images` directory with a hash before their name.

These images include those that are small and fundamental to the application's appearance (icons, textures, logos, etc).

I expect that a `projects` subdirectory will likely be added here soon for more project-specific images like galleries and screen shots.

NB: If an SVG is loaded via the URL loader I don't believe there's a way to then also in-line that SVG in the HTML (as required for path/fill animation etc).

### File Loader Images

Images placed here will be copied directly into the `images` directory untouched. This is limited to images that are referenced in code dynamically, meta tags, or used by other plug-ins (such as favicons). Any place a file path is dynamically generated, I decided it was easiest to simply point to the image here.

These images are subdivided as follows:

- *experience*: logos for the experience list (defined in `content`)
